{"name":"Latin OCR","tagline":"","body":"### Latin OCR\r\nThis project aims to develop high-quality OCR processes and results for digitized Latin books. For the first phase of the project, we're OCR'ing [21,509 books identified as potentially containing Latin content in the Internet Archive](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/latin.html), using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) 3.04.00 with the v0.3.0 [Latin](https://ryanfb.github.io/latinocr/) and v2.0 [Ancient Greek](https://ancientgreekocr.org/) language training files.
